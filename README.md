## 🗂️ Datasets

### 📍 Mendeley Dataset

* Brain tumor MRI images
* Labeled into multiple tumor categories

---

### 📍 Figshare Dataset

* Publicly available brain MRI dataset
* Used to improve model generalization

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Load MRI images from both datasets
* Organize into class folders

---

### 2️⃣ Preprocessing

* Resize images (e.g., 224×224)
* Normalize pixel values
* Apply augmentations:

  * Rotation
  * Flipping
  * Scaling

---

### 3️⃣ Model Architecture

Typical pipeline:

* CNN / Transformer backbone
* Feature extraction
* Fully connected classification head

---

### 4️⃣ Training Strategy

* Train separately on:

  * Mendeley dataset
  * Figshare dataset
* Compare performance across datasets
* Optional: Combine datasets for better generalization

---

### 5️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

---
